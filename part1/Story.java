NB! The example output might align wrong on narrow displays. 
If you're using only a limited portion of the browser window, or your display is 
otherwise very narrow, try to stretch the display horizontally to see if the text 
aligns differently. The exercise expects the text to align as it does on wider 
displays.

Write a program that asks the user for a character's name and their job.
The program then prints a short story.

The output must be as shown below â€” note, the name and job depend on the user's input.

output:-
--------
I will tell you a story, but I need some information first.
What is the main character called?
Bob
What is their job?
a builder
Here is the story:
Once upon a time there was Bob, who was a builder.
On the way to work, Bob reflected on life.
Perhaps Bob will not be a builder forever.

I will tell you a story, but I need some information first.
What is the main character called?
Ada
What is their job?
a Data scientist
Here is the story:
Once upon a time there was Ada, who was a Data scientist.
On the way to work, Ada reflected on life.
Perhaps Ada will not be a Data scientist forever.
